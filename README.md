# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Secrets integration

Create the following file `secrets.js` under `src` folder:
```
export const API_KEY = 'yourtoken'
export const BASE_URL = 'baseurl'
```

Then replace placeholders.

## Launching the app

Start the app with [`yarn start`](#yarn-start)

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode and should open [http://local.themoviedb.org:3000/](http://local.themoviedb.org:3000/).\
In case it doesn't properly handle opening the app, go to [http://local.themoviedb.org:3000/](http://local.themoviedb.org:3000/) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
